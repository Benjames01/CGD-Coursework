## Explanation: 

To play the game you need to enter the "Dungeon Portal". This will transport you to a randomly selected dungeon. While in the lair, it is up to you to decide if you will fight mobs, with melee or magic; explore for loot, or seek out the big boss.

Progressing through fighting will allow you to gain experience points and coins. These can then be used to upgrade your weapons and power up your magic spells.
